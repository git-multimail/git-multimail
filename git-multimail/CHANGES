Release 1.1.0
=============

* When a single commit is pushed, omit the reference changed email.
  Set multimailhook.combineWhenSingleCommit to false to disable this
  new feature.

* In gitolite environments, the pusher's email address can be used as
  the From address by creating a specially formatted comment block in
  gitolite.conf (see multimailhook.from in README).

* Support for SMTP authentication/SSL was added, see smtpUser,
  smtpPass, smtpEncryption in README.

* A new option scanCommitForCc was added to allow git-multimail to
  search the commit message for 'Cc: ...' lines, and add the
  corresponding emails in Cc.

* If $USER is not set, use the variable $USERNAME. This is needed on
  Windows platform to recognize the pusher.

* The emailPrefix variable can now be set to an empty string to remove
  the prefix.

* A short tutorial was added in doc/gitolite.rst to set up
  git-multimail with gitolite.

* The post-receive file was renamed to post-receive.example. It has
  always been an example (the standard way to call git-multimail is to
  call git_multimail.py), but it was unclear to many users.

* A new refchangeShowGraph option was added to make it possible to
  include both a graph and a log in the summary emails.  The options
  to control the graph formatting can be set via the new graphOpts
  option.
