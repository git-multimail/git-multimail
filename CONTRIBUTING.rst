git-multimail is an open-source project, built by volunteers. We would
welcome your help!

The current maintainers are Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>
and Matthieu Moy <matthieu.moy@grenoble-inp.fr>.

Please note that although a copy of git-multimail is distributed in
the "contrib" section of the main Git project, development takes place
in a separate git-multimail repository on GitHub:

    https://github.com/git-multimail/git-multimail

Whenever enough changes to git-multimail have accumulated, a new
code-drop of git-multimail will be submitted for inclusion in the Git
project.

We use the GitHub issue tracker to keep track of bugs and feature
requests, and we use GitHub pull requests to exchange patches (though,
if you prefer, you can send patches via the Git mailing list with CC
to the maintainers). Please sign off your patches as per the `Git
project practice
<https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L234>`__.

General discussion of git-multimail can take place on the main Git
mailing list,

    git@vger.kernel.org

Please CC emails regarding git-multimail to the maintainers so that we
don't overlook them.
