This update added new revisions after undoing existing revisions.
That is to say, some revisions that were in the old version of the
annotated tag are not in the new version.  This situation occurs
when a user --force pushes a change and generates a repository
containing something like this:

 * -- * -- B -- O -- O -- O   (902dfe1)
            \
             N -- N -- N   refs/tags/tag-annotated (bc4a4a6)

You should already have received notification emails for all of the O
revisions, and so the following emails describe only the N revisions
from the common base, B.

Any revisions marked "omit" are not gone; other references still
refer to them.  Any revisions marked "discard" are gone forever.

No new revisions were added by this update.
