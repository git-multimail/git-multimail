Aids to testing git-multimail.

This directory contains some scripts that can be used to help test
git-multimail.  The tests are not very complete and not very
automated, but they do catch many errors.

It is likely that the test scripts only work correctly on Linux/Unix,
and it is quite possible that they require a newer version of Python
than does the git-multimail script itself.


Test scripts
============

create-test-repo:

    Create a test repository "test-repo.git" that can be used for
    testing git-multimail.  Most of the repository is created by
    loading the dumpfile "test-repo.dump", then a few more weird tags
    are created that point to objects other than commits.

test-emails:

    Runs create-test-repo and then simulates a bunch of pushes to the
    repository, writing to stdout the emails that would normally be
    sent for those pushes.  There's as yet no automated check of the
    output; you still have to eyeball it.

smudge-compare:

    Smudges the test-emails output to remove output that will vary
    from one run to the next.

test-env:

    Runs through various configuration scenarios for
    GenericEnvironment and GitoliteEnvironment and verifies that the
    environments have set the correct values for the
    template-expansion parameters.


Guidelines
==========

For an approximate test that you haven't broken anything, run

    $ ./test-emails >/tmp/multimail.new 2>&1
    $ ./smudge-compare /tmp/multimail.new

Also check that your changes haven't broken the environment classes:

    $ t/test-env
